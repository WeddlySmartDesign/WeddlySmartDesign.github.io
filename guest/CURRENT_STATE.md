# GUEST by WeddlySmartDesign — CURRENT STATE
Updated: 2026-10-02

## Continuity rule
This is the first file to read before any further GUEST work.
Do not resume from chat text alone.
Do not reopen sealed competitive research.
Do not touch ONE, ONE Partner or STUDIO.
Do not publish GUEST automatically.

## Product/technical track — SEALED
The independent GUEST product, engine and commercial/release-preparation track completed B0–B9 QA on `guest-independent`.
Canonical pre-design release-preparation baseline: `dac667cffa863fadb65411f6abef7e72ddf04f59`.
Canonical CI run: `36836190260`, all jobs success.
B8 final report: `guest/B8_FINAL_COMMERCIAL_SEAL_QA_2026-10-01.md`.
B9 final report: `guest/B9_FINAL_RELEASE_PREPARATION_SEAL_2026-10-01.md`.
Publication remains ON HOLD because the final catalog invitation art direction is not approved.
The GUEST management engine remains in standby until a real invitation direction passes visual approval.

## Invitation design track — SEALED HISTORY
- Microblock 01 market map — SEALED.
- Microblock 02 best-of + market gap — SEALED.
- Microblock 03 technical/operational baseline — SEALED.
- Microblock 04 GOLD STANDARD pilot specification — SEALED.
- GOLD 01 — REJECTED: corporate/editorial, below target.
- GOLD 02 — REJECTED: still below premium target / Canva-reproducible.
- AI visual pipeline pilot `gold` — PIPELINE VALIDATED, CATALOG DIRECTION REJECTED.

Primary checkpoints:
- `guest/GUEST_COMPETITIVE_DIRECTION_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-02.md`
- `guest/GUEST_DIRECTION_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-02.md`
- `guest/GUEST_GOLD_STANDARD_PILOT_01_2026-10-02.md`

- `guest/GUEST_AI_VISUAL_PIPELINE_CHECKPOINT_2026-10-02.md`

## AI VISUAL PIPELINE — VALIDATED
Recraft proved capable of generating a coherent premium wedding visual universe from a strong style reference, including opening/hero/closing continuity and a venue reinterpretation.

The `gold` direction itself is NOT a catalog candidate.
Owner Android verdict: too overloaded. It stacks silk + pearls + florals + particles + banquet/venue and becomes visually excessive.

Do not keep polishing `gold`.
Its value is proof that the asset-generation method works.

## Non-negotiable rules for the REAL invitation
1. One dominant art direction/material language per invitation; supporting cues stay subordinate.
2. Restraint and breathing room over accumulation of luxury cues.
3. No return to corporate/editorial web sections.
4. RSVP inside the invitation is only a visually integrated CTA/button that opens the existing GUEST RSVP flow. Do not build a second inline RSVP form.
5. No visible `GUEST`, `WeddlySmartDesign` or `by WeddlySmartDesign` branding in the customer-facing wedding invitation.
6. GUEST engine remains untouched until the real invitation direction is approved.
7. Owner intervention remains limited to opening finished mobile versions and light feedback.

## REAL invitation functional/visual requirements
See `guest/GUEST_REAL_INVITATION_CONTENT_MOTION_REQUIREMENTS_2026-10-02.md`.
The system must support names/date, premium opening, cover/hero, cover/sub-cover couple photography, venue/location, RSVP CTA into existing GUEST RSVP and designed closing. Countdown, agenda, couple-story text, secondary photography and final swipe gallery are configurable/optional blocks.
Motion remains NOT YET VALIDATED and is now a separate gate.

## Motion gate — GATE 01 FAIL / GATE 02 FAIL / GATE 03 ACTIVE
`GUEST_MOTION_GATE_01.html` failed Android review because the cover behaved mainly like a moving raster/block and the gallery felt like web UI.
`GUEST_MOTION_GATE_02_LAYERED.html` also failed Android review on 2026-10-02. Root cause: it attempted to simulate depth by clipping and independently moving regions copied from one flattened raster. Real-device motion exposed hard seams, duplicated image regions, rectangular fragments and broken continuity.

Technical conclusion: premium object-led motion CANNOT be built reliably by slicing a flattened JPG/PNG after generation. The visual assets must be authored/exported as true independent layers from the beginning.
Required source planes for the next test: clean background plate; transparent veil/silk; transparent pearls/ornament; transparent foreground floral/object layer; optional particles/light overlay; typography kept native in HTML/CSS.

## Motion Gate 03 candidate
Conversation artifact: `GUEST_MOTION_GATE_03_TRUE_LAYERS.html`.
This test intentionally contains NO raster image sliced into regions. The motion planes are genuine independent DOM/SVG layers: background plate, veil, two silk planes, pearl strands with individual beads, foreground florals, atmospheric particles/light and native typography.
Scope is intentionally only opening + short hero depth state. Gallery/closing are excluded until this passes Android.
Static/structural QA: HTML parse PASS; JavaScript syntax PASS; no external assets or `/mnt/data` runtime references; responsive viewport + reduced-motion fallback present.

## Exact NEXT ACTION
1. Owner opens `GUEST_MOTION_GATE_03_TRUE_LAYERS.html` on Android and judges ONLY the motion/depth, not final catalog art direction.
2. If PASS, proceed to a separate gallery-swipe + closing motion test using the same true-layer principle.
3. If FAIL, do not start the real catalog direction; diagnose the motion language/technology itself before continuing.
