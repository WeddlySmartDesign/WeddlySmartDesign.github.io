# GUEST by WeddlySmartDesign — CURRENT STATE
Updated: 2026-10-01

## Continuity rule
This file is the FIRST file to read before doing any further GUEST work.
Never resume from chat text alone.
Never restart a closed block.
Never infer the current block from the user's last visible message.
Resume from the exact "NEXT ACTION" below.

B7 final sealed report:
`guest/B7_7_FINAL_VISUAL_SEAL_QA_2026-10-01.md`

Validated B7 HEAD:
`4728b6ff8cf78d904c94cfb11927cea4624ffbba`

Validated GitHub Actions run:
`36733355182` — 14/14 jobs `success`

## Current block
B8.1 — QA flujo comercial: landing → selección → checkout

Current branch:
`guest-independent`

## B8 scope
B8 = QA del flujo comercial completo, sin rediseñar el producto funcional ya sellado.

Microbloques:
- B8.1 landing comercial → selección Essential/Signature → entrada a checkout
- B8.2 checkout → pago → retorno y preservación de pedido
- B8.3 recogida de datos/personalización tras compra
- B8.4 activación/entrega y acceso real al producto
- B8.5 estados de error, cancelación, reintento y duplicidad
- B8.6 regresión comercial móvil/escritorio + sellado final de B8

## Exact current failure
None yet. B8.1 is ACTIVE and must be audited against the real commercial files before any change is made.

Commercial files already present:
- `guest/guest.html`
- `guest/guest-checkout.html`
- `guest/guest-checkout-return.html`
- `guest/guest-order.html`
- `guest/guest-legal.html`

## NEXT ACTION
Audit B8.1 on the real `guest-independent` files: verify that every commercial CTA and package choice on `guest/guest.html` routes to the correct GUEST checkout with the intended Essential/Signature choice preserved, no ONE/Partner/STUDIO dependency, no dead path and coherent behavior on mobile/desktop. Add an automated B8.1 gate, run the full existing QA matrix, fix only proven commercial-flow defects, then seal B8.1.

## Working method from now on
Every microblock has only three states:
- ACTIVE
- PASS / SEALED
- FAIL with one exact NEXT ACTION

After every meaningful fix that changes the unresolved failure, update this file before continuing.
If a chat/tool session is interrupted, re-read this file and resume from NEXT ACTION.
