# GUEST by WeddlySmartDesign — CURRENT STATE
Updated: 2026-10-01

## Continuity rule
This file is the FIRST file to read before doing any further GUEST work.
Never resume from chat text alone.
Never restart a closed block.
Never infer the current block from the user's last visible message.
Resume from the exact "NEXT ACTION" below.

B7 final sealed report:
`guest/B7_7_FINAL_VISUAL_SEAL_QA_2026-10-01.md`

Validated B7 HEAD:
`4728b6ff8cf78d904c94cfb11927cea4624ffbba`

Validated GitHub Actions run:
`36733355182` — 14/14 jobs `success`

## Current block
B8.2 — QA checkout → pago → retorno y preservación de pedido

Current branch:
`guest-independent`

## B8 scope
B8 = QA del flujo comercial completo, sin rediseñar el producto funcional ya sellado.

Microbloques:
- B8.1 landing comercial → selección Essential/Signature → entrada a checkout
- B8.2 checkout → pago → retorno y preservación de pedido
- B8.3 recogida de datos/personalización tras compra
- B8.4 activación/entrega y acceso real al producto
- B8.5 estados de error, cancelación, reintento y duplicidad
- B8.6 regresión comercial móvil/escritorio + sellado final de B8

## Exact current failure
B8.2 frontend/backend contract is green and the live GUEST Stripe checkout can create LIVE sessions.

Objective remaining failure:
Stripe LIVE currently has only the ONE webhook endpoint:
`https://dnjsxequwgtyyauuofxj.supabase.co/functions/v1/weddly-stripe-checkout`

There is no enabled Stripe webhook endpoint yet for:
`https://dnjsxequwgtyyauuofxj.supabase.co/functions/v1/guest-stripe-checkout`

The GUEST Edge Function v5 already contains signed, idempotent webhook handling and preserves browser-return provisioning as fallback. A fake signature is rejected with HTTP 400 `invalid_signature`.

The connected Stripe credential has `webhook_read` but not `webhook_write`, so the missing endpoint cannot be created from the current connection without an explicit Stripe permission change.

## NEXT ACTION
Create the Stripe LIVE webhook endpoint for `guest-stripe-checkout` with at least `checkout.session.completed` and `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`, then store that endpoint's signing secret as `GUEST_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in the Supabase project and verify a signed delivery. Until then B8.2 remains FAIL / BLOCKED BY STRIPE CONFIGURATION, not sealed.

B8.3 may proceed independently; do not reopen B8.1 or B7.

## Working method from now on
Every microblock has only three states:
- ACTIVE
- PASS / SEALED
- FAIL with one exact NEXT ACTION

After every meaningful fix that changes the unresolved failure, update this file before continuing.
If a chat/tool session is interrupted, re-read this file and resume from NEXT ACTION.
