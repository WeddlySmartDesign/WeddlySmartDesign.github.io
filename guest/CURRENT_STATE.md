# GUEST by WeddlySmartDesign — CURRENT STATE
Updated: 2026-10-01

## Continuity rule
This file is the FIRST file to read before doing any further GUEST work.
Never resume from chat text alone.
Never restart a closed block.
Never infer the current block from the user's last visible message.
Resume from the exact "NEXT ACTION" below.

B7 final sealed report:
`guest/B7_7_FINAL_VISUAL_SEAL_QA_2026-10-01.md`

Validated B7 HEAD:
`4728b6ff8cf78d904c94cfb11927cea4624ffbba`

Validated GitHub Actions run:
`36733355182` — 14/14 jobs `success`

## Current block
B8.2 — QA checkout → pago → retorno y preservación de pedido

Current branch:
`guest-independent`

## B8 scope
B8 = QA del flujo comercial completo, sin rediseñar el producto funcional ya sellado.

Microbloques:
- B8.1 landing comercial → selección Essential/Signature → entrada a checkout
- B8.2 checkout → pago → retorno y preservación de pedido
- B8.3 recogida de datos/personalización tras compra
- B8.4 activación/entrega y acceso real al producto
- B8.5 estados de error, cancelación, reintento y duplicidad
- B8.6 regresión comercial móvil/escritorio + sellado final de B8

## Exact current failure
B8.1 is PASS / SEALED.

B8.2 has one objective resilience gap under audit: the live `guest-stripe-checkout` function provisions the purchase and sends the post-payment email when the browser calls `status` after returning from Stripe, but the current function source has no Stripe webhook handler. A paid session therefore depends on the customer reaching the return/status flow for automatic provisioning.

This is not yet marked fixed until the GUEST backend has an idempotent signed-webhook path and the corresponding Stripe webhook endpoint/signing secret are verified.

## NEXT ACTION
Audit and harden B8.2 only in GUEST: add automated checkout/return contract QA; port an idempotent signed Stripe webhook handler into `guest-stripe-checkout` without touching ONE; preserve the existing browser-return fallback; verify the deployed GUEST function; then verify or explicitly record the remaining Stripe endpoint configuration dependency before sealing B8.2.

## Working method from now on
Every microblock has only three states:
- ACTIVE
- PASS / SEALED
- FAIL with one exact NEXT ACTION

After every meaningful fix that changes the unresolved failure, update this file before continuing.
If a chat/tool session is interrupted, re-read this file and resume from NEXT ACTION.
