# GUEST by WeddlySmartDesign — CURRENT STATE
Updated: 2026-10-01

## Continuity rule
This file is the FIRST file to read before doing any further GUEST work.
Never resume from chat text alone.
Never restart a closed block.
Never infer the current block from the user's last visible message.
Resume from the exact "NEXT ACTION" below.

B7 final sealed report:
`guest/B7_7_FINAL_VISUAL_SEAL_QA_2026-10-01.md`

Validated B7 HEAD:
`4728b6ff8cf78d904c94cfb11927cea4624ffbba`

Validated GitHub Actions run:
`36733355182` — 14/14 jobs `success`

## Current block
B8.3 — QA recogida de datos/personalización tras compra

Current branch:
`guest-independent`

## B8 scope
B8 = QA del flujo comercial completo, sin rediseñar el producto funcional ya sellado.

Microbloques:
- B8.1 landing comercial → selección Essential/Signature → entrada a checkout
- B8.2 checkout → pago → retorno y preservación de pedido
- B8.3 recogida de datos/personalización tras compra
- B8.4 activación/entrega y acceso real al producto
- B8.5 estados de error, cancelación, reintento y duplicidad
- B8.6 regresión comercial móvil/escritorio + sellado final de B8

## Exact current failure
B8.2 is PASS / CLOSED.

Verified LIVE:
- GUEST Stripe webhook endpoint is enabled and independent from ONE.
- Events: `checkout.session.completed` and `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`.
- GUEST webhook signing secret is stored encrypted in Supabase Vault.
- `guest-stripe-checkout` v12 reads the GUEST secret without exposing it in GitHub/code.
- Live config returns HTTP 200 with Essential 39.90 EUR and Signature 49.90 EUR.
- Invalid webhook signature returns HTTP 400 `invalid_signature`.
- Browser-return provisioning remains as a fallback.

B8.3 first automated run failed due to a QA wait-condition defect, not a confirmed product defect. The test waited for a GUEST edition label in an already-submitted simulated order; that state legitimately goes directly to the completion panel. QA wait condition corrected in commit `414979c5152b796dc35350cd61ad8069d4d2dde1`.

## NEXT ACTION
Run B8.3 order-personalization QA again. If green, seal B8.3 and proceed directly to B8.4 activation/delivery and real product access. If red, inspect the exact failing assertion before changing product code.

## Working method from now on
Every microblock has only three states:
- ACTIVE
- PASS / SEALED
- FAIL with one exact NEXT ACTION

After every meaningful fix that changes the unresolved failure, update this file before continuing.
If a chat/tool session is interrupted, re-read this file and resume from NEXT ACTION.
